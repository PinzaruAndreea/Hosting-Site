# Hosting-Site
I created a site from scratch with the help of an udemy course. I used mainly CSS (with Flexbox and Grid), but we also learned a little bit of JS. The lecturer started by explaining the behaviour of the elements on the viewport, depending on the size of the page.
In order to make the page responsive, I had to double- (and triple-) check the page continuosly to make sure the newly added element will look just fine, even if the device that is used was smaller/bigger.
I was also taught that a page should be made responsive "mobile-first" since most users access websites through their phones, rather than on a desktop/laptop. While I am quite proud of what I achieved thus far, there's still some more for me to learn (and there will always be,since programming languages are constantly updating).
Enjoy!
